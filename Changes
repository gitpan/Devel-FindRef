Revision history for Perl extension Devel::FindRef

1.31 Sun Jul 20 18:38:17 CEST 2008
	- correctly identify the main program and function call
          argument vectors (patch by Paul LeoNerd Evans).
	- use ref2ptr instead of +0 to correctly get the address
          of overloaded variables (reported by Paul LeoNerd Evans).
	- use UV in ptr2ref, as perl seems to do the same internally.

1.3  Sat Jul 12 00:17:03 CEST 2008
	- ignore the new "our" PVMG sv's from perl 5.10.
	- apply a lot of fixes by Chris Heath,
          handling constant functions and WEAKOUTSIDE better.
        - avoid following circular reference chains.
        - add some visual clues to the output string.
        - look into anonymous closures to see where they were cloned.
        - introduce PERL_DEVEL_FINDREF_DEPTH env variable.
